 1001  brew update && brew install azure-cli
 1002  az version
 1003  az extension add -n ml -y
 1004  az login
 1005  az account set --subscription xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
 1006  az group create --name aml-dev-rg --location eastus2
 1007  az ml workspace create -n aml-ws -g aml-dev-rg -l eastus2
 

 . You will need to remove old extensions if they are installed for your CLI to work properly. You
can remove the old ml extensions by running the following commands:
az extension remove -n azure-cli-ml
az extension remove -n ml
. To install the ml extension, run the following command:
az extension add -n ml -y
. Now, letâ€™s connect to your subscription in Azure through the Azure CLI by running the following
command here, replacing xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx with the
Subscription ID information you found in Figure 1.5:
az login
az account set --subscription xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
. Create a resource group by running the following command. Please note that rg_name is an
example name for the resource group, just as aml-ws is an example name for an AML workspace:
az group create --name aml-dev-rg --location eastus2
. Create an AML workspace by running the following command, noting that eastus2 is the
Azure region in which we will deploy this AML workspace:
az ml workspace create -n aml-ws -g aml-dev-rg -l eastus2
You have now created an AMLS workspace with the Azure CLI ml extension
